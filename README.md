# Ohmeter
An Ohm's law calculator in C. I was bored.

Once compiled, you feed it the Voltage and the Resistor value and it will spit out the current (I) in Amps and the Power (P) in Watts.
It's really just Ohm's law in C. 

### Ohm's law:
The current (I) = Voltage (V) / Resistance (Ohms). The Power (P) = I * V (Current * Voltage)

### To compile:
`gcc ohmeter.c -o ohmeter`
